# StarWars-node-hangman
This is a basic Node based CLI game that is Star Wars themed. I utilized three different npm packages to help gameplay. The first npm package was request which called a Star Wars word API. Second was Inquirer, which allowed inputs for the gameplay. Last was the Star Wars Me npm package that gave me randomized ascii art to stylize the terminal. Below is a video of the game play or feel free to download the various packages to get the game running. The main point of this game was to use constructor functions to assist the flow of the game play in Node.
